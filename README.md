This is a web-app website made in Javascript and Firebase SaaS to listen to cultural educative contents while moving on transportation vehicle.

The point of interests are pre-built for the ride, the contents are fetched by open source encyclopedia ([Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)) and there's in use a TTS engine ([eSpeak](https://github.com/kripken/speak.js)/[MeSpeak](https://www.masswerk.at/mespeak/)) and GPS tracking.

The working project is ready with metro station of Barcelona metro line L1.

### Usage
